# NOTE: Your submission should be your GitHub URL that contains all the following files 
# that were worked in class, along with the files associated with this assignment. In total you should have:

# 1) Write a class named RetailItem that holds data about an item in a retail store. 
# The class should store the following data in attributes: item description, units in inventory, and price. 
# Once you have written the class, write a program that creates three RetailItem objects and 
# stores the following data in them:

# 2) Write a class named Car that has the following data attributes:
#     _ _year_model (for the car’s year model)
#     _ _make (for the make of the car)
#     _ _speed (for the car’s current speed)

# The Car class should have an _ _init_ _ method that accepts the car’s year model and make as arguments. 
# These values should be assigned to the object’s _ _year_model and _ _make data attributes. 
# It should also assign 0 to the _ _speed data attribute.

# The class should also have the following methods:

#     accelerate - The accelerate method should add 5 to the speed data attribute each time it is called.
#     brake - The brake method should subtract 5 from the speed data attribute each time it is called.
#     get_speed - The get_speed method should return the current speed.

# Next, design a program that creates a Car object then calls the accelerate method five times. 
# After each call to the accelerate method, get the current speed of the car and display it. 
# Then call the brake method five times. After each call to the brake method, get the current speed of the car and display it.
